# 🚘 ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) System using Django

This project is a complete Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system built using **Python**, **Django**, **OpenCV**, and **EasyOCR**. It captures frames from uploaded videos, extracts vehicle number plates using OCR, and stores both the image and text in a database. An Excel report is generated with the extracted data and saved in the `media/` folder.
